💡 About This Build

This frontend was **born in Builder.io** — where we quickly sketched, styled, and experimented with layouts at lightning speed ⚡.  
From there, we fused it with an **AI-assisted Vibe Coding workflow**: taking Builder.io exports and evolving them into a **React + Vite powerhouse**.  

👉 **What is Vibe Coding?**  
Vibe coding is an **AI-assisted software development process**, coined by **Andrej Karpathy**, where developers use natural language prompts to guide a **large language model (LLM)** in generating, refining, and debugging code.  
Instead of focusing on line-by-line coding, developers engage in a **conversational, high-level interaction with AI**.  

This "vibe" approach is particularly powerful for:  
- ⚡ **Fast prototyping**  
- 🎨 **Creative exploration**  
- 🛠️ **Developing throwaway projects** to test ideas quickly  

By combining **Builder.io prototyping** with **Vibe Coding**, we built a hackathon-ready frontend that is both **fast to create** and **flexible to scale** — balancing creativity with clean engineering. 🚀
